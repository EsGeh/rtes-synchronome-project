# Synchronome Project - Conclusion

The Program has successfully been tested running on the specified platform (Linux + Raspberry Pi Model 4B + C270 HD Webcam) at a resolution of 320x240 for Ta = (1/3)s & Tc = 1s and Ta = (1/30)s & Tc = (1/10)s.

Example output and logfiles are in the `./doc/examples/` directory.

## Results and Outlook

- File I/O to the Flash drive is the main bottleneck
- Logging and tracing to the file system introduces competetion for the file system. Decoupling logging into a seperate thread is decisive to prevent erratic blocking of real-time services when logging

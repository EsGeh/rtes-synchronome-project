  This project is an exercise in realtime embedded engineering.
  An embedded computer connected to a camera periodically takes pictures of a ticking clock and saves them to persistent memory (Flash).
  The program outputs one image each second, each showing a still image of the seconds hand in one stationary position.
  (or one image each 1/10th of a second if the clock displays 1/10ths of a second).
  In order to achieve that, the process of taking/picking pictures needs to be carefully synchronized with the external clock.

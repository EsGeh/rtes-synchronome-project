# Synchronome Project

This project is the [fourth part](https://www.coursera.org/learn/real-time-project-embedded-systems) of the [Realtime Embedded Systems Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/real-time-embedded-systems) by the *University of Colorado Boulder* via Coursera.

Course Description:

> The final course emphasizes hands-on building of an application using real-time machine vision and multiple real-time services to synchronize the internal state of Linux with an external clock via observation.
> 
> - Outcome 1: Decompose a problem and set of basic real-time requirements into software modules and Linux POSIX real-time threads
> - Outcome 2: Analyze services in terms of C (execution time), T (request period), and D (deadlines for completion) to establish feasibility and margin for meeting requirements
> - Outcome 3: Design and construct a solution for a native Linux system equipped with a webcam to verify and demonstrate system synchronization using machine vision processing
